interface ThoughtGraph {
    layout:"spread"|"tree"|"board"|"tiled"

    // board is just means theirs some defined elements and u make stuff with them
    // kinda like  a UML diagram but actually usefull like Unities or blenders shader editor

    // tiled has the layout like a workspace but when u click on a item it goes into it (like a tree)

    // tree is like the layout u see in a file system

    // spread is like tree layout but unstructured or structured very differently
